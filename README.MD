# Sort_Visualizer

This is a web application I built to visualize sorting algorithms in action. I’ve always been fascinated by how different algorithms work behind the scenes, and this project gave me a chance to explore them more deeply while building something interactive and educational.

## About the Project

Sorting Visualizer lets users see how various sorting algorithms operate step by step. You can adjust the size of the array, control the speed of the animation, and watch how elements are compared, swapped, and sorted in real time. It’s a fun and intuitive way to better understand the logic and efficiency behind different sorting techniques.

## Live Demo
